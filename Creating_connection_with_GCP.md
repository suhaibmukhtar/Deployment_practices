1. Verify the Correct Username
The username you use to connect must match the one associated with your SSH key on the VM. GCP often generates usernames based on your email address. To determine the correct username:​
Stack Overflow

Check the SSH Key Comment:

Open your public SSH key file (e.g., gcp_key.pub) and note the username at the end of the key. It typically looks like:​

ssh-rsa AAAAB3... adnaannazir10
In this example, adnaannazir10 is the username.​

Use the Correct Username in Your SSH Command:

When connecting, ensure you're using this username:​

ssh -i "C:\Users\adnaa\.ssh\gcp_key" adnaannazir10@34.16.109.51
2. Ensure the SSH Key is Added to the VM
For the VM to recognize your SSH key:​

Add Your Public Key to the VM:

In the GCP Console, navigate to your VM instance.​

Click on "Edit" and scroll to the "SSH Keys" section.​

Add the contents of your gcp_key.pub file.​

Save the changes.​

3. Check for OS Login Configuration
If OS Login is enabled, it can override SSH key settings:​

Verify OS Login Status:

Go to the GCP Console.​

Navigate to "Compute Engine" > "Metadata".​
Stack Overflow

Check for the enable-oslogin key:​

If it's set to TRUE, OS Login is enabled.

If it's set to FALSE or absent, OS Login is disabled.

Adjust Accordingly:

If OS Login is enabled and you prefer to manage SSH keys via metadata, consider disabling it by setting enable-oslogin to FALSE.​

Alternatively, configure OS Login appropriately to grant access.​

4. Verify File Permissions
Ensure your SSH key files have the correct permissions:​

Set Private Key Permissions:

On your local machine, adjust the permissions:​

chmod 600 C:\Users\adnaa\.ssh\gcp_key
This ensures that only you can read the private key.​

5. Connect Using the SSH Command
After performing the above steps, attempt to connect:​

ssh -i "C:\Users\adnaa\.ssh\gcp_key" adnaannazir10@34.16.109.51


To test your SSH key and ensure that you can connect to your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Virtual Machine (VM), follow these steps:

---

### **1. Verify SSH Key Pair**

Ensure that you have both the private and public SSH key files:

- **Private Key**: Typically named `gcp_key` or similar.
- **Public Key**: Typically named `gcp_key.pub`.

If you haven't generated these keys, you can create them using:


```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/gcp_key -C "your_username"
```


---

### **2. Add Public Key to GCP VM**

To allow SSH access, add your public key to your VM's metadata:

1. **Access VM Instances**:
   - Navigate to the [VM instances page](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances) in the Google Cloud Console.

2. **Edit SSH Keys**:
   - Click on your VM instance.
   - Click the "Edit" button at the top.
   - Scroll down to the "SSH Keys" section.
   - Click "Add item" and paste the contents of your `gcp_key.pub` file.
   - Click "Save" to apply the changes.

---

### **3. Test SSH Connection**

Attempt to connect to your VM using the private key:


```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/gcp_key your_username@your_vm_external_ip
```


- **`your_username`**: The username associated with your SSH key.
- **`your_vm_external_ip`**: The external IP address of your VM.

If the connection is successful, you've correctly set up your SSH keys.

---

### **4. Troubleshooting**

If you encounter a "Permission denied (publickey)" error:

- **Ensure Correct Username**: The username should match the one associated with the SSH key added to the VM.
- **Verify Firewall Rules**: Ensure that your VM's firewall rules allow SSH traffic on port 22.
- **Check Key Permissions**: The private key file should have appropriate permissions:

  
```bash
  chmod 600 ~/.ssh/gcp_key
  ```


For a detailed guide on connecting to GCP VMs using SSH, refer to the [GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/connect/standard-ssh).

---

By following these steps, you can test and confirm that your SSH key is correctly configured for accessing your GCP VM.
